## 2025-12-14 - v1.6.38

### Bug Fixes

- When returning to Software Update screen after a background download completes, the UI now shows "Ready to Install" instead of forcing re-download
- Added `findCompletedDownload()` method to check for existing downloaded update files
- Added `hasCompletedDownload` state to persist completed download information across page navigation

## 2025-12-14 - v1.6.37

### Alert Folder Structure
- Create centralized `AlertFolderUtils` utility for consistent folder path handling across all components
- Standardize alert folder structure: `active/{regionFolder}/{folderName}/`
- Photos stored in `images/` subfolder with sequential naming (`photo1.png`, `photo2.png`, etc.)
- Comments stored in `comments/` subfolder with format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_AUTHOR.txt`
- Region folder calculated as rounded coordinates (e.g., `49.7_8.6`)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix photo upload to station when creating alerts via desktop UI - photos are now uploaded after being saved locally
- Fix station alert file path regex to support `images/` subfolder in upload/download paths
- Fix `_findAlertById` to search recursively within `active/{region}/` directory structure
- Fix UI photo save path to use correct `active/{regionFolder}/{folderName}/images/` structure

### Code Quality
- Remove duplicate folder path functions from `report.dart`, `station_alert_service.dart`, `station_alert_api.dart`, and `pure_station.dart`
- All components now use shared `AlertFolderUtils` for path construction

### Testing
- Enhanced `app_alert_test.dart` with folder structure consistency checks
- Verify `images/` subfolder exists on station after photo upload
- Test sequential photo naming (`photo1.ext`, `photo2.ext`)
- All 49 folder structure tests passing

## 2025-12-14 - v1.6.36

### UI Improvements
- Add keyboard navigation to photo viewer (Left/Right arrows to browse, Escape to close)
- Auto-capitalize first letter in Title and Description fields when creating alerts
- Improve location picker default zoom from 10 to 17 for better usability
- Remember user's preferred zoom level in location picker between sessions

### Bug Fixes
- Refresh alert data after successful comment and point/unpoint sync to station

## 2025-12-14 - v1.6.35

### Alert Comments
- Add comment sync between clients and station
- Comments submitted to station are now downloaded by other clients during sync
- Alert details API now includes full comment list with author, timestamp, and content

### Station API Improvements
- Merge CLI and GUI station API handlers into shared `StationAlertApi` class
- Both CLI (`pure_station.dart`) and GUI (`station_server_service.dart`) now use identical handlers
- Add POST `/{callsign}/api/alerts/{folderName}/comment` endpoint for adding comments
- Alert details endpoint now includes `comments`, `comment_count`, `pointed_by`, `verified_by`, `last_modified`, and `report_content` fields
- Fix HTTP status handling - use `http_status` field to avoid conflict with alert `status` field
- Handle report parsing failures gracefully - still return raw `report_content` for client sync

### Testing
- Add comment flow tests to `tests/app_alert_test.dart`
- Test Client B adding comment, station sync, and Client A receiving comment

### Documentation
- Update API.md with comment endpoint and expanded alert details response
- Document comment object structure and all new response fields

## 2025-12-14 - v1.6.34

### Bug Fixes
- Fix photo upload path for station alerts - use coordinate-based folder name instead of date-based ID
- Photo files are now correctly uploaded alongside alert data when sharing to stations
- Fix NOSTR event format for alert sharing - use `{type: 'EVENT', event: {...}}` instead of array format

### Station Server Improvements
- StationServerService now uses `AppArgs().port + 1` as default port instead of hardcoded 8080
  - Prevents port conflicts when running multiple instances
  - Station API port is always API port + 1 (e.g., API on 3456 means station on 3457)
- Added `runningPort` getter to get the actual port the station server is running on
- Added alert file upload handler - POST `/{callsign}/api/alerts/{folderName}/files/{filename}`
- Added alert file download handler - GET `/{callsign}/api/alerts/{folderName}/files/{filename}`
- Station now stores uploaded photos locally instead of proxying to connected clients

### UI Improvements
- Increase default zoom level from 10 to 16 when selecting alert location on map
- Auto-capitalize first letter when writing comments in Alert Details

### Debug API
- Add `alert_share` action to share alerts via NOSTR and upload photos to station
- Add `photo` parameter to `alert_create` action for creating test alerts with photos
- Add recursive search for alerts in nested directory structure
- Add `station_server_start` action to start the station server programmatically
- Add `station_server_stop` action to stop the station server
- Add `station_server_status` action to get station server status including running port
- Add `alert_upload_photos` action for direct HTTP photo upload to station

### Testing
- Add comprehensive Dart test for alert photo functionality (`tests/alert_photo_test.dart`)
- Test launches temporary station + 2 clients for end-to-end alert photo verification

### Documentation
- Update API.md with new debug API actions for alert testing
- Expand alert format specification with photo handling details
