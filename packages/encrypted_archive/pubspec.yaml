# Note: sqlite3_flutter_libs is required for Flutter apps but not listed here
# because it's a Flutter plugin. Instead, the main app's pubspec.yaml must include
# sqlite3_flutter_libs as a dependency for Flutter builds. For CLI/pure Dart builds,
# the native SQLite library must be available on the system or bundled in libs/.
