# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## What is this?

Before contributing to Geogram, each contributor must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This grants the Geogram project permission to license and relicense contributions under any license, including licenses other than the current Apache License 2.0.

This protects the project's ability to evolve its licensing in the future while giving contributors clear attribution for their work.

## How to sign

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to a new file named `CLA/<your-github-username>.md`.
2. Replace the placeholder fields with your full name, GitHub username, and the current date.
3. Submit a pull request with the signed file.

That's it. Your CLA only needs to be submitted once and covers all future contributions.

## Agreement summary

By signing, you agree that:

- All your contributions to Geogram are licensed under the project's current license (Apache License 2.0).
- Geogram may license and relicense your contributions under any license of its choosing in the future.
