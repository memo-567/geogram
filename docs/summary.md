# Geogram Documentation Summary

Quick reference guide to all documentation files. Use this to quickly find which specific file to read for detailed information.

## Core Architecture & APIs

### API.md
HTTP API endpoints for the Geogram server. Covers station API, device API, log API, file browsing, status endpoints, and debug API. Essential for understanding how devices communicate with the station and with each other.

### API_feedback.md
Centralized feedback API system for all Geogram apps. Defines a reusable `/api/feedback` endpoint supporting likes, points, dislikes, subscriptions, verifications, emoji reactions, and comments across all content types (alerts, blog posts, forum threads, events, etc.). Uses NOSTR-signed messages for authentication and interoperability. Includes complete folder structure specification, file formats, NOSTR event kinds, authentication rules, request/response examples, error handling, and migration guides.

### BLE.md
Bluetooth Low Energy implementation details. Describes the BLE advertisement format, HELLO handshake protocol, device discovery, GATT characteristics, and how devices exchange data over Bluetooth.

### EventBus.md
Application-wide event bus system. Explains how different parts of the application communicate via events, event types, publishers, subscribers, and the event lifecycle.

### chat-api.md
Chat-specific HTTP API endpoints. Details the REST API for chat rooms, messages, attachments, and room management. Covers both station-hosted and device-hosted chat rooms.

### command-line-switches.md
CLI arguments and flags for running the application. Documents all available command-line options, switches, and their purposes for different execution modes.

### data-transmission.md
Data transmission protocols and formats. Describes how data is packaged, compressed, and transmitted between devices across different connection types (WiFi, BLE, Internet).

### device-connection-labels.md
Connection path labels displayed in the Devices UI. Explains connection types (WiFi, Internet, Bluetooth, LoRa), verification methods, connection priority order, and how labels are added/removed based on device reachability.

### security-settings.md
Security and privacy settings documentation. Covers HTTP API toggle, debug API toggle, and location granularity settings. Explains how location privacy works and how coordinates are rounded before sharing.

### station-implementation-plan.md
Comprehensive plan for implementing station functionality (root and node stations). Includes UI specifications, models, services, channel bridging, points/reputation system, and authority management. This is a planning document for future implementation.

## Tutorials

### tutorials/publish-new-version.md
Step-by-step guide for releasing new versions. Covers version numbering, changelog updates, git tagging, automated builds, and the release script usage. Essential for anyone publishing updates.

## Implementation Plans

### plan/app-alert-fix.md
Analysis and fix plan for alert folder structure inconsistencies. Documents issues with different folder structures between clients and stations, proposes standardization using active/expired folders and timestamp-based naming.

### plan/chat-with-voice-messages.md
Detailed plan for adding voice message support to 1:1 direct messages. Covers audio format selection (Opus/WebM), storage strategy, UI widgets, bandwidth optimization, and cross-platform implementation.

### plan/irc-bridge-implementation.md
Implementation plan for IRC bridge allowing IRC clients to connect to Geogram chat. Describes server integration, channel mapping, NOSTR identity for guests, bidirectional message flow, and security considerations.

## Bridge Documentation

### bridges/IRC.md
User-facing documentation for the IRC bridge. Explains how to connect with IRC clients (irssi, WeeChat, HexChat), channel naming conventions, authentication, supported features, limitations, and troubleshooting.
