## Overview

This document specifies the text-based format used for storing postcards in the Geogram system. The postcards collection type implements a sneakernet-based message delivery system where messages are physically carried from sender to recipient through one or more intermediate carriers.

Unlike traditional internet-based messaging, postcards rely on physical proximity and human mobility to deliver messages, similar to how physical mail worked before the internet age.

### Key Features

- **Sneakernet Delivery**: Messages physically carried by mobile users (carriers)
- **Cryptographic Stamps**: Each carrier stamps the postcard with signature proof
- **Chain of Custody**: Tamper-proof verification of entire journey
- **Flexible Routing**: Messages pass through multiple carriers to reach destination
- **Delivery Receipts**: Cryptographic proof of successful delivery
- **Return Journey**: Receipts can travel back to sender with acknowledgment
- **Payment Proof**: Stamps and receipts enable payment verification (external to Geogram)
- **Open or Encrypted**: Messages can be readable by carriers or encrypted
- **Geographic Routing**: Carriers select postcards based on recipient coordinates
- **Contributor System**: Carriers can add photos/notes proving transit
- **Date-Based Organization**: Organized by creation date like events
- **NOSTR Integration**: Uses npub for identities and Schnorr signatures

### Conceptual Model

Think of Geogram postcards like physical postcards sent through the postal system:

1. **Sender** writes postcard and hands it to first carrier
2. **Carriers** stamp it at each handoff (like post offices stamping mail)
3. **Recipient** receives postcard and stamps delivery receipt
4. **Receipt** travels back to sender through carriers (optionally)
5. **Sender** stamps acknowledgment confirming receipt delivery

Each stamp is cryptographically signed, creating an unbreakable chain of custody that proves:
- Who carried the message
- When and where each handoff occurred
- That the content was not tampered with
- That delivery was successful

## File Organization

            └── postcard.txt
```

### Postcard Folder Naming

**Pattern**: `YYYY-MM-DD_msg-{message-id}/`

**Message ID**:
- First 6 characters of SHA-256 hash of postcard content
- Lowercase hexadecimal
- Ensures uniqueness
- Human-readable identifier

**Examples**:
```
2025-11-21_msg-a7c5b1/      # Created Nov 21, 2025
2025-11-22_msg-3d8f2e/      # Created Nov 22, 2025
2024-12-25_msg-9b4e6a/      # Created Dec 25, 2024
```

### Year Organization

- **Format**: `postcards/YYYY/` (e.g., `postcards/2025/`, `postcards/2024/`)
- **Purpose**: Organize postcards by year for archival
- **Creation**: Automatically created when first postcard for that year is added
- **Benefits**: Easy year-based browsing, archival, and cleanup

### Special Directories

**`.reactions/` Directory**:
- Hidden directory (starts with dot)
- Contains reaction files for postcard
- Filename: `postcard.txt`

**`contributors/` Directory**:
- Contains folders for each carrier who contributed
- Carrier folders named by CALLSIGN
- Each carrier can add photos/notes proving transit

**`.hidden/` Directory** (see Moderation System):
- Hidden directory for moderated content
- Contains files/comments hidden by moderators
- Not visible in standard UI

## Postcard Format

### Main Postcard File

Every postcard must have a `postcard.txt` file in the postcard folder root.

**Complete Structure**:
```

- Like physical postcards - anyone can read
- Useful for public messages, greetings
- Lower privacy but full transparency
- Carriers can verify message content

**Use Cases**:
- Greetings and postcards from travel
- Public announcements
- Community messages
- Non-sensitive information

**Example**:
```
TYPE: open

Hello from Paris! Having a great time.
The Eiffel Tower is as beautiful as they say.

-CR7BBQ
```

### Encrypted Postcards

**TYPE: encrypted**

**Characteristics**:
- Content encrypted using NIP-04 (NOSTR encrypted DM standard)
- Only sender and recipient can read content
- Header remains public (for routing)
- Stamps remain public (for verification)
- Higher privacy

**Use Cases**:
- Private messages
- Sensitive information
- Personal communications
- Confidential data

**Encryption Process**:
1. Sender encrypts content with recipient's npub (using ECDH)
2. Encrypted content base64 encoded
3. Only recipient's nsec can decrypt
4. Carriers cannot read content

**Example**:
```
TYPE: encrypted

<NIP-04 encrypted content>
AAAAt2VuY3J5cHRlZCBjb250ZW50IGhlcmU...
</NIP-04>
```

    - Signs: header + content + all previous stamps + this stamp
    - Creates tamper-proof chain

### Adding a Stamp

**Process**:
```
1. Carrier receives postcard (via BLE, LoRa, Radio, or physical handoff)
2. Carrier verifies all previous signatures
3. Carrier adds new STAMP section:
   - Fills in their callsign, npub
   - Records current timestamp
   - Records current GPS coordinates
   - Notes who they received it from
   - Notes transmission method used (RECEIVED_VIA)
   - Increments hop number
4. Carrier signs entire postcard (up to and including new stamp)
5. Carrier appends signature to stamp
6. Postcard now has one more stamp in the chain
```

### Stamp Example

```
## STAMP: 1
STAMPER_CALLSIGN: BRAVO2
STAMPER_NPUB: npub1bravo2abc123...
TIMESTAMP: 2025-11-21 14:30_00
COORDINATES: 38.7223,-9.1393

```

### Stamp Verification

**Verification Process**:
```
1. For each stamp (in order):
   a. Extract stamper's npub
   b. Extract signature
   c. Reconstruct signable content:
      - Header + content + all stamps up to this one
   d. Verify Schnorr signature
   e. If invalid, reject postcard as tampered
2. If all stamps valid, postcard is trusted
3. Display stamps with verification badges
```

## Delivery Receipt

### Overview

When the postcard reaches the recipient, the recipient stamps a delivery receipt. This proves:
- The postcard was successfully delivered
- Who delivered it (last carrier's npub)
- When and where it was delivered
- Recipient acknowledges receipt

### Receipt Format

**Structure**:
```
## DELIVERY_RECEIPT
RECIPIENT_NPUB: <npub>
DELIVERED_AT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM_ss
DELIVERED_BY: <npub>
COORDINATES: <lat>,<lon>
LOCATION_NAME: <name> (optional)
--> signature: hex_signature
```

**Fields**:

```

### Status Update

After delivery receipt is added:
- Update `STATUS: delivered` in header
- Postcard now ready for return journey (optional)
- Recipient can read content (if encrypted, using their nsec)

## Return Journey

### Overview

After delivery, the postcard can optionally travel back to the sender carrying the delivery receipt. This allows the sender to verify successful delivery and serves as proof of completion (especially important for paid delivery services).

The return journey works exactly like the outbound journey, but with "RETURN_STAMP" sections.

### Return Stamp Format

**Structure**:
```
## RETURN_STAMP: <number>
STAMPER_CALLSIGN: <callsign>
STAMPER_NPUB: <npub>
TIMESTAMP: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM_ss
COORDINATES: <lat>,<lon>
LOCATION_NAME: <name> (optional)
RECEIVED_FROM: recipient|<npub>
RECEIVED_VIA: <transmission-method>
HOP_NUMBER: <number>
--> signature: hex_signature
```

**Characteristics**:
- Identical format to outbound STAMP
- Labeled "RETURN_STAMP" instead of "STAMP"
- Sequential numbering starting from 1
- HOP_NUMBER counts hops from recipient back to sender
- RECEIVED_FROM starts with "recipient" for first return carrier
- RECEIVED_VIA documents transmission method (same options as outbound stamps)

### Return Journey Example

```
## DELIVERY_RECEIPT
RECIPIENT_NPUB: npub1xyz789...
DELIVERED_AT: 2025-11-22 18:45_00
DELIVERED_BY: npub1alpha...
COORDINATES: 41.8781,-87.6298
--> signature: m5n6o7p8q9r0...

## RETURN_STAMP: 1
STAMPER_CALLSIGN: DELTA4
STAMPER_NPUB: npub1delta...

COORDINATES: 40.7128,-74.0060
LOCATION_NAME: NYC Central Station
RECEIVED_FROM: recipient
RECEIVED_VIA: Meshtastic
HOP_NUMBER: 1
--> signature: s1t2u3v4w5x6...

## RETURN_STAMP: 2
STAMPER_CALLSIGN: ECHO5
STAMPER_NPUB: npub1echo...
TIMESTAMP: 2025-11-24 12:30_00
COORDINATES: 38.7223,-9.1393
LOCATION_NAME: Lisbon Airport
RECEIVED_FROM: npub1delta...
RECEIVED_VIA: LoRa
HOP_NUMBER: 2
--> signature: y7z8a9b0c1d2...
```

### Return Journey Routing

**Finding the Sender**:
- Carriers read SENDER_NPUB and SENDER_CALLSIGN from header
- If sender's usual locations known, route toward those
- Alternatively, carriers heading toward sender's region take it
- Eventually delivered to sender or someone who can hand it to sender

## Sender Acknowledgment

### Overview

When the postcard (with delivery receipt) returns to the sender, the sender stamps a final acknowledgment. This completes the full cycle and proves:
- Sender received the delivery receipt
- Sender confirms successful delivery
- Payment can be settled (if applicable)

### Acknowledgment Format

**Structure**:
```
## SENDER_ACKNOWLEDGMENT
SENDER_NPUB: <npub>
ACKNOWLEDGED_AT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM_ss
--> signature: hex_signature
```

**Fields**:

1. **Sender NPUB** (required)
   - Must match SENDER_NPUB in header
   - Example: `SENDER_NPUB: npub1abc123...`
   - Proves identity of sender

2. **Acknowledged At** (required)
   - Timestamp when sender received return postcard
   - Format: `ACKNOWLEDGED_AT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM_ss`
   - Example: `ACKNOWLEDGED_AT: 2025-11-24 15:30_00`

3. **Signature** (required)
   - Sender signs entire postcard + acknowledgment
   - Proves sender confirms receipt delivery
   - Format: `--> signature: hex_signature`

### Acknowledgment Example

```
## SENDER_ACKNOWLEDGMENT
SENDER_NPUB: npub1abc123def456...
ACKNOWLEDGED_AT: 2025-11-24 15:30_00
--> signature: e3f4g5h6i7j8...
```

### Status Update

After sender acknowledgment:
- Update `STATUS: acknowledged` in header
- Postcard journey complete
- All parties have cryptographic proof of delivery
- Payment can be settled based on stamps

## Contributor System

### Overview

Carriers can add photos, notes, and other content as "contributors" to prove they physically transported the postcard. This creates a rich narrative of the postcard's journey.

CREATED: 2025-11-21 14:35_00

Carried this postcard from Lisbon to the airport.

Stopped at my favorite cafe for a coffee before heading
to the train station. Photo attached showing the postcard
at the cafe to prove I had it at this location.

--> npub: npub1bravo...
--> signature: hex_sig...
```

**Purpose**:
- Describe carrier's contribution
- Add narrative to journey
- Prove physical possession at specific locations
- Optional - contributor folder can exist without it

### Contributor Photos

Carriers can add photos proving transit:

**Examples**:
- Photo of postcard at specific landmark
- Selfie with postcard at location
- Receipt showing date/location
- Transit ticket showing route

**Naming**:
- Descriptive filenames (e.g., `cafe-photo.jpg`, `delivery-proof.jpg`)
- Standard image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)

### Contributor Permissions

**Contributor Folder Owner** (Carrier):
- Add/edit/delete files in their own folder
- Edit contributor.txt
- Cannot modify other contributors' folders
- Cannot modify main postcard.txt

**Sender** (Postcard Creator):
- View all contributor folders
- Can moderate inappropriate content
- Cannot edit contributor content

**Recipient**:
- View all contributor folders
- Can react/comment on contributions

## Signature Verification Chain

### Overview

The signature chain is the core security mechanism of postcards. Each stamp signs the entire postcard history, creating an unbreakable chain of custody.

### Chain Construction

**Initial State** (Sender Creates Postcard):
```
Content to sign:
  Header + Content

Sender signs with their nsec
→ Signature stored in sender metadata
```

**After First Stamp**:
```
Content to sign:
  Header + Content + Sender Metadata + STAMP 1 (without signature)

Stamper 1 signs with their nsec
→ Signature stored in STAMP 1
```

**After Second Stamp**:
```
Content to sign:
  Header + Content + Sender Metadata + STAMP 1 (with signature) + STAMP 2 (without signature)

Stamper 2 signs with their nsec
→ Signature stored in STAMP 2
```

**Pattern**:
Each new signature covers everything before it, including all previous signatures.

### Tamper Detection

**Scenario**: Someone tries to modify the message content after stamps added.

**Result**:
1. Modification changes header or content
2. All stamp signatures become invalid (they signed the original content)
3. Verification fails
4. Postcard rejected as tampered

**Security**:
- Any modification to any part breaks all subsequent signatures
- Carriers verify before adding their stamp
- Recipients verify before accepting delivery
- Sender verifies when receiving return

### Verification Algorithm

**Process**:
```python
def verify_postcard(postcard):
    # 1. Verify sender signature
    content = postcard.header + postcard.content
    if not verify_schnorr(content, postcard.sender_signature, postcard.sender_npub):
        return False

    # 2. Verify each stamp in order
    signed_content = content + postcard.sender_metadata
    for stamp in postcard.stamps:
        signed_content += stamp.without_signature()
        if not verify_schnorr(signed_content, stamp.signature, stamp.stamper_npub):
            return False
        signed_content += stamp.signature_line()

    # 3. Verify delivery receipt (if present)
    if postcard.has_delivery_receipt():
        signed_content += postcard.delivery_receipt.without_signature()
        if not verify_schnorr(signed_content, receipt.signature, receipt.recipient_npub):
            return False

    # 4. Verify return stamps (if present)
    for return_stamp in postcard.return_stamps:
        signed_content += return_stamp.without_signature()
        if not verify_schnorr(signed_content, return_stamp.signature, return_stamp.stamper_npub):
            return False
        signed_content += return_stamp.signature_line()

    # 5. Verify sender acknowledgment (if present)
    if postcard.has_acknowledgment():
        signed_content += postcard.acknowledgment.without_signature()
        if not verify_schnorr(signed_content, ack.signature, ack.sender_npub):
            return False

    return True  # All signatures valid!
```

### Trust Model

**No Trusted Third Party**:
- No central authority needed
- Verification is purely cryptographic
- Anyone can verify the entire chain
- Trust comes from signatures, not from a server

**Payment Proof**:
- Stamps prove who carried and when
- Receipt proves delivery
- Acknowledgment proves sender got receipt
- Cryptographically unforgeable
- Payment settlement uses this proof (external to Geogram)

## Recipient Discovery

### Overview

Unlike traditional messaging where both parties must be online simultaneously, postcards use geographic hints to help carriers find the recipient.

### Recipient Locations Field

**Format**: `RECIPIENT_LOCATIONS: lat1,lon1; lat2,lon2; lat3,lon3`

**Purpose**:
- List of coordinates where recipient might be found
- Could be:
  - Home location
  - Work location
  - Frequent hangout spots
  - Places they visit regularly
  - General region they inhabit

**Carrier Selection**:
Carriers filter postcards based on:
1. Are any recipient locations near my route?
2. Am I heading toward recipient's region?
3. Do I know someone near recipient's locations?

### Example

```
RECIPIENT_LOCATIONS: 38.7223,-9.1393; 51.5074,-0.1278; 40.7128,-74.0060
```

Recipient might be found at:
- Lisbon, Portugal (38.7223,-9.1393)
- London, UK (51.5074,-0.1278)
- New York City, USA (40.7128,-74.0060)

Carriers traveling to or through any of these locations would consider carrying this postcard.

### Privacy Considerations

**Public Information**:
- Recipient locations are public (in header)
- Necessary for routing
- Should be general areas, not exact addresses
- Recipient can list multiple locations to improve delivery chances

**Recommendations**:
- Use public places (cafes, train stations, city centers)
- Use neighborhood-level precision, not house addresses
- Update locations if recipient moves
- List 2-5 locations for best results

## Status Tracking

### Status Values

**in-transit**:
- Postcard is moving through carriers
- Has at least one stamp
- No delivery receipt yet
- Default status after sender creates postcard

**delivered**:
- Recipient has stamped delivery receipt
- Postcard successfully reached destination
- May begin return journey
- Payment may be due to carriers

**acknowledged**:
- Sender has stamped acknowledgment
- Full cycle complete
- All parties have proof
- Payment can be settled

**expired**:
- TTL exceeded
- Postcard should be discarded
- Delivery failed
- No payment owed

### Status Transitions

```
in-transit → delivered  (recipient stamps delivery receipt)
delivered → acknowledged  (sender stamps acknowledgment)
in-transit → expired  (TTL exceeded)
delivered → expired  (TTL exceeded before return)
```

### Status Display

**UI Indicators**:
- 📦 in-transit: Moving through network
- ✅ delivered: Successfully delivered
- 🔁 acknowledged: Full cycle complete
- ⏰ expired: Delivery failed (TTL)

## Reactions System

```

## Moderation System

### Overview

The sender (as postcard creator) can moderate inappropriate contributor content by hiding it in the `.hidden/` directory.

### Hidden Content Directory

**Location**: `<postcard-folder>/.hidden/`

**Purpose**: Store content hidden by sender

### Moderation Actions

**Hide Contributor Photo**:
1. Sender selects inappropriate photo
2. Move to `.hidden/files/`
3. Create metadata file noting reason
4. Log moderation action

**Hide Contributor Comment**:
1. Sender selects inappropriate comment
2. Move to `.hidden/comments/`
3. Log moderation action

### Moderation Log

**File**: `.hidden/moderation-log.txt`

**Format**:
```
> 2025-11-22 10:00_00 -- CR7BBQ (sender)
ACTION: hide_file
TARGET: contributors/BRAVO2/inappropriate.jpg
REASON: Inappropriate content
```

## NOSTR Integration

### NOSTR Keys

**npub (Public Key)**:
- Bech32-encoded public key
- Format: `npub1` followed by encoded data
- Purpose: Identity verification

**nsec (Private Key)**:
- Never stored in files
- Used for signing
- Kept secure in user's keystore

### Signature Format

**Sender Signature**:
```
--> npub: npub1abc123...
--> signature: hex_signature_of_header_and_content
```

**Stamp Signature**:
```
--> signature: hex_signature_of_postcard_up_to_this_stamp
```

### Signature Verification

1. Extract npub and signature
2. Reconstruct signable content
3. Verify Schnorr signature (BIP-340)
4. Display verification badge if valid

### NIP-04 Encryption

**For Encrypted Postcards**:
1. Sender computes shared secret with recipient's npub (ECDH)
2. Encrypt content using AES-256-CBC
3. Base64 encode encrypted content
4. Store in content section
5. Recipient decrypts using their nsec

## Parsing Implementation

### Postcard File Parsing

```
1. Read postcard.txt as UTF-8 text
2. Verify first line starts with "# POSTCARD: "
3. Extract title
4. Parse header fields:
   - CREATED, SENDER_CALLSIGN, SENDER_NPUB (required)
   - RECIPIENT_CALLSIGN, RECIPIENT_NPUB, RECIPIENT_LOCATIONS (required)
   - TYPE, STATUS (required)
   - TTL, PRIORITY, PAYMENT_REQUESTED (optional)
5. Find content section (after header blank line)
6. Parse content until metadata
7. Parse sender metadata (npub, signature)
8. Parse STAMP sections (sequential)
9. Parse DELIVERY_RECEIPT (if present)
10. Parse RETURN_STAMP sections (if present)
11. Parse SENDER_ACKNOWLEDGMENT (if present)
12. Verify signature chain
```

### Stamp Parsing

```
1. Find "## STAMP: N" marker
2. Parse stamper fields:
   - STAMPER_CALLSIGN, STAMPER_NPUB
   - TIMESTAMP, COORDINATES, LOCATION_NAME
   - RECEIVED_FROM, RECEIVED_VIA, HOP_NUMBER
3. Extract signature
4. Verify signature against postcard content up to this stamp
```

### Signature Verification

```
1. For sender signature:
   - Sign: header + content
   - Verify with sender's npub
2. For each stamp:
   - Sign: header + content + sender_metadata + all_previous_stamps + this_stamp_without_sig
   - Verify with stamper's npub
3. For delivery receipt:
   - Sign: header + content + all_stamps + receipt_without_sig
   - Verify with recipient's npub
4. For return stamps and acknowledgment:
   - Same process, accumulating signed content
```

## File Operations

### Creating a Postcard

```
1. User fills in postcard details:
   - Title, recipient info, content
   - Type (open/encrypted)
   - Priority, TTL, payment request
2. If encrypted:
   - Encrypt content with NIP-04
   - Use recipient's npub
3. Generate message ID (first 6 chars of SHA-256)
4. Create folder: postcards/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD_msg-{id}/
5. Create postcard.txt with header and content
6. Sender signs header + content
7. Append sender metadata with signature
8. Create .reactions/ directory
9. Set STATUS: in-transit
10. Ready for first carrier
```

### Adding a Stamp

```
1. Carrier receives postcard (via BLE, LoRa, Radio, etc.)
2. Carrier verifies all existing signatures
3. If any signature invalid, reject postcard
4. Carrier adds new STAMP section:
   - Generate stamp number (next sequential)
   - Fill in carrier's callsign and npub
   - Record current timestamp and coordinates
   - Note received_from (previous stamper's npub or "sender")
   - Note received_via (transmission method used)
   - Calculate hop_number (previous + 1)
5. Sign entire postcard up to and including new stamp
6. Append signature to stamp
7. Save updated postcard.txt
```

### Stamping Delivery Receipt

```
1. Recipient receives postcard from last carrier
2. Recipient verifies all stamps
3. Recipient adds DELIVERY_RECEIPT section:
   - RECIPIENT_NPUB (must match header)
   - Current timestamp and coordinates
   - Last carrier's npub (DELIVERED_BY)
4. Sign entire postcard including receipt
5. Append signature
6. Update STATUS: delivered
7. Save postcard.txt
8. Optionally begin return journey
```

### Adding Return Stamp

```
1. Carrier receives postcard with delivery receipt
2. Verify all signatures (outbound + receipt)
3. Add RETURN_STAMP section:
   - Same format as regular stamp
   - Sequential numbering starting from 1
   - RECEIVED_FROM starts with "recipient"
4. Sign entire postcard including return stamp
5. Append signature
6. Save postcard.txt
```

### Stamping Sender Acknowledgment

```
1. Postcard (with receipt) returns to sender
2. Sender verifies all signatures (outbound + receipt + return stamps)
3. Sender adds SENDER_ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
   - SENDER_NPUB (must match header)
   - Current timestamp
4. Sign entire postcard including acknowledgment
5. Append signature
6. Update STATUS: acknowledged
7. Save postcard.txt
8. Journey complete!
```

### Creating Contributor Folder

```
1. Carrier who stamped postcard wants to add content
2. Create contributors/ folder if not exists
3. Create contributors/CALLSIGN/ folder
4. Optionally create contributor.txt with description
5. Add photos/files proving transit
6. Set permissions (755 for folder, 644 for files)
```

## Best Practices

### For Senders

1. **Accurate recipient info**: Provide correct npub and multiple locations
2. **Choose type wisely**: Use encrypted for sensitive content
3. **Set reasonable TTL**: Give enough time for delivery (e.g., 7-30 days)
4. **Indicate payment**: Set PAYMENT_REQUESTED if you'll pay carriers
5. **Request return**: Ask carriers to return postcard if you need proof
6. **Monitor status**: Check if delivered, acknowledge receipt
7. **Moderate contributors**: Review and hide inappropriate content

### For Carriers

1. **Verify before stamping**: Always verify all previous signatures
2. **Accurate stamps**: Record correct timestamp and coordinates
3. **Add contributions**: Provide photos/notes proving you carried it
4. **Respect privacy**: Don't try to decrypt encrypted postcards
5. **Timely handoff**: Pass to next carrier or recipient promptly
6. **Geographic routing**: Select postcards heading near your route

### For Recipients

1. **Stamp receipt promptly**: Confirm delivery as soon as received
2. **Enable return**: Allow postcard to return to sender with receipt
3. **Thank carriers**: React/comment to appreciate carriers' work
4. **Verify signatures**: Check signature chain before trusting content

### For Developers

1. **Validate signatures**: Always verify entire chain before accepting
2. **Handle TTL**: Automatically expire and clean up old postcards
3. **Optimize routing**: Help carriers find relevant postcards
4. **Display journey**: Show stamps and contributors in timeline UI
5. **Support encryption**: Implement NIP-04 correctly
6. **Index efficiently**: Build indexes for status, sender, recipient

### For System Administrators

1. **Storage limits**: Set reasonable limits per user/collection
2. **Monitor TTL**: Clean up expired postcards regularly
3. **Backup postcards**: Regular backups of collections
4. **Track statistics**: Monitor delivery rates, hop counts

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Security

**Signature Chain**:
- Any tampering breaks signatures
- Verification is purely cryptographic
- No trusted third party needed
- Sender, recipient, and carriers all verifiable

**Encryption**:
- NIP-04 provides end-to-end encryption
- Only sender and recipient can read encrypted content
- Carriers cannot decrypt
- Header remains public for routing

### Privacy Considerations

**Public Information**:
- Sender npub/callsign (necessary for identity)
- Recipient npub/callsign (necessary for routing)
- Recipient locations (necessary for carrier selection)
- All stamps (necessary for proof of transit)
- Delivery receipt (necessary for payment proof)

**Private Information**:
- Message content (if TYPE: encrypted)
- Sender/recipient relationship (somewhat revealed by routing)

**Recommendations**:
- Use encrypted type for sensitive content
- Use general locations (neighborhoods, not exact addresses)
- Consider privacy when listing recipient locations

### Payment Security

**Proof of Work**:
- Stamps prove carriers actually handled postcard
- Timestamps show when
- Coordinates show where
- Signatures prevent forgery

**Settlement Process** (external to Geogram):
1. Sender and carriers agree on payment terms beforehand
2. Postcard travels, accumulating stamps
3. Delivery receipt proves successful delivery
4. Sender reviews stamps and receipt
5. Payment settled based on cryptographic proof
6. Stamps serve as receipts for payment

**Security**:
- Stamps cannot be forged (signature verification)
- Delivery cannot be faked (recipient must sign)
- Return journey proves sender received receipt
- Sender acknowledgment finalizes proof

### Threat Mitigation

**Stamp Forgery**:
- Impossible due to signature requirement
- Forger would need stamper's nsec (private key)
- All participants can verify independently

**Content Tampering**:
- Breaks all subsequent signatures
- Immediately detected on verification
- Postcard rejected as invalid

**Spam**:
- TTL limits lifetime
- Size limits prevent abuse
- Carriers can filter by sender reputation
- Recipients can block specific senders

**Denial of Service**:
- Carriers voluntarily choose what to carry
- No obligation to carry all postcards
- Filtering by payment, priority, sender
- TTL ensures old postcards expire

## Integration with Relay System

### Relationship to Relay Messages

Postcards are built on top of the existing relay message system:

**Relay Message System Provides**:
- BLE protocol for transmission
- Markdown file format
- Geographic routing
- Stamp mechanism
- NOSTR signature support
- TTL and expiration
- Priority handling

**Postcards Add**:
- Collection type organization (by date)
- Formal recipient discovery (RECIPIENT_LOCATIONS)
- Delivery receipt semantics
- Return journey concept
- Sender acknowledgment
- Contributor system
- UI for postcard-specific features

### Technical Integration

**Transmission**:
- Postcards transmitted as relay messages via BLE
- When carrier receives postcard, stamping adds relay stamp
- Relay system handles the physical delivery mechanism
- Collection system handles organization and display

**Storage**:
- Relay messages stored in relay/ folder (transient)
- Postcards stored in postcards/ collection (permanent)
- When postcard delivered, can be saved to collection
- Relay storage can be cleared, collection preserved

**Compatibility**:
- Postcard format compatible with relay message format
- Can convert relay message to postcard for archival
- Stamps in both systems have same format
- Signatures work the same way

### File Conversion

**Relay Message to Postcard**:
```
1. Relay message arrives via BLE
2. If destination is local user, save as postcard
3. Create postcards/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD_msg-{id}/ folder
4. Save postcard.txt from relay message
5. Keep all stamps and signatures
6. Add to collection for permanent storage
```

**Postcard to Relay Message**:
```
1. User creates postcard in collection
2. Export postcard.txt as relay message
3. Transmit via BLE to first carrier
4. Carrier stamps and forwards
5. Eventually reaches recipient
6. Recipient saves back to their postcards collection
```
