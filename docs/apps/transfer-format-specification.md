## Overview

The Transfer app provides a centralized download/upload/streaming center for Geogram. It handles all file transfers across apps with unified progress tracking, retry logic, resume capability, and a full management UI.

### Key Features

1. **Bidirectional transfers**: Downloads, uploads, and streaming
2. **Resume capability**: Interrupted transfers can continue from last position
3. **Transport-aware**: Automatically switches between BLE/LoRa, LAN, and internet paths with resume
4. **Automatic retry**: Exponential backoff with configurable limits
5. **Patient mode**: Waits up to 30 days for offline peers
6. **Priority queue**: Urgent, high, normal, and low priorities
7. **Manual control**: Pause, resume, cancel, and retry operations
8. **Ban list**: Block specific callsigns from initiating downloads
9. **Verification**: Size and hash validation (negotiate SHA-1 when possible) before final placement
10. **Metrics**: Comprehensive statistics and per-transport breakdowns
11. **EventBus integration**: Apps receive notifications on transfer events

### Design Philosophy

- **Centralized**: All apps use a single transfer service
- **Non-blocking**: Files placed at destination only after complete and verified
- **Patient**: Tolerates offline peers with extended waiting periods
- **Observable**: Real-time progress and metrics for monitoring
- **Resilient**: Automatic recovery from network failures

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Transfer** | A single file being uploaded, downloaded, or streamed |
| **Queue** | Ordered list of pending transfers waiting for execution |
| **Worker** | Process that executes individual transfers |
| **Worker Pool** | Manager for concurrent transfer workers |
| **Patient Mode** | Extended waiting period for offline peers |
| **Transport** | Connection method: LAN, WebRTC, Station, BLE, LoRa |
| **Callsign** | Unique identifier for a Geogram device |
| **Station** | Relay server for indirect connections |
| **Locator** | Address of a transfer target: either `http(s)://...` or `/CALLSIGN/path` |
| **Transfer Record** | Per-transfer JSON file capturing history, verification, and segment stats |
| **Transport Segment** | Portion of a transfer completed over a specific transport (BLE/LAN/Internet) |

## File Organization

### Storage Structure

Transfer data is stored in a dedicated directory:

```
{data_dir}/transfers/
├── settings.json                    # Global transfer settings
├── queue.json                       # Active and queued transfers
├── metrics.json                     # Statistics and metrics
├── cache/                           # Verified payload cache (keyed by hash+path)
├── records/                         # Per-transfer JSON records (auto-pruned after 30 days)
│   └── tr_abc123.json
└── history/                         # Completed transfer archives
    ├── 2025-12.json                 # Monthly history files
    ├── 2025-11.json
    └── ...
```

### Naming Conventions

- **History files**: Named by year-month `YYYY-MM.json`
- **Transfer IDs**: Format `tr_{uuid}` (e.g., `tr_abc123def456`)
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 format with timezone

## Configuration Files

  "max_queue_size": 1000,
  "banned_callsigns": [],
  "updated_at": "2026-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | string | "1.0" | Settings format version |

| `max_queue_size` | integer | 1000 | Maximum queued transfers |
| `banned_callsigns` | array | [] | Callsigns blocked from downloads |
| `updated_at` | string | - | Last settings update timestamp |

### Queue File

`{data_dir}/transfers/queue.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "transfers": [
    {
      "id": "tr_abc123",
      "direction": "download",
      "locator_type": "http",                // http | callsign_path
      "remote_url": "http://p2p.radio/download.zip", // for HTTP(S) downloads
      "source_callsign": "X1ABCD",
      "source_station_url": "https://station.example.com",
      "target_callsign": "X2BCDE",
      "remote_path": "/files/photo.jpg",
      "local_path": "/downloads/photo.jpg",
      "filename": "photo.jpg",
      "expected_bytes": 1048576,
      "expected_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
      "transport_candidates": ["lan", "station", "ble"], // order attempted
      "cache_hit": false,
      "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
      "status": "queued",
      "priority": "normal",
      "bytes_transferred": 0,
      "retry_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2026-01-01T10:00:00Z",
      "started_at": null,
      "completed_at": null,
      "last_activity_at": null,
      "next_retry_at": null,
      "error": null,
      "transport_used": null,
      "speed_bytes_per_second": null,
      "requesting_app": "gallery",
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- `remote_url` is required for HTTP(S) downloads and omits callsign fields.
- `locator_type` clarifies how the locator is interpreted (`http` vs `callsign_path` such as `/X1ABCD/file.zip` for non-IP/BLE/LoRa).
- `transport_candidates` defines the fallback order; a new transport segment is opened on each switch.
- `cache_hit` is set when the transfer is immediately fulfilled from the verified cache without network usage.

    }
  ]
}
```

## Transfer Lifecycle

The lifecycle begins before a worker is allocated:
1. **Cache/dedup check**: If a verified cached file exists (hash match), the transfer is marked complete with `cache_hit=true`.
2. **Resume from record**: If a prior record exists, resume from the last verified byte range and carry over completed segments.
3. **Queue entry**: Pending work enters the priority queue and proceeds through the states below.

### States

```
[queued] --> [connecting] --> [transferring] --> [verifying] --> [completed]
    |              |               |                  |
    |              v               v                  v
    +---------> [waiting] <----+----+             [failed]
    |              |           |
    |              v           |
    +---------> [paused] <-----+
    |
    v
[cancelled]
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `queued` | Waiting in queue for an available worker |
| `connecting` | Establishing connection to remote peer |
| `transferring` | Active data transfer in progress |
| `verifying` | Checking integrity (size/hash) |
| `completed` | Successfully finished and file placed at destination |
| `failed` | Permanently failed after all retries exhausted |
| `cancelled` | User cancelled the transfer |
| `paused` | User paused the transfer |
| `waiting` | Waiting for offline peer (patient mode) |

### State Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| queued | connecting | Worker picks up transfer |
| queued | paused | User pauses |
| queued | cancelled | User cancels |
| connecting | transferring | Connection established |
| connecting | waiting | Peer offline |
| connecting | failed | Connection error (retries exhausted) |
| transferring | verifying | Transfer complete |
| transferring | waiting | Connection lost |
| transferring | paused | User pauses |
| transferring | cancelled | User cancels |
| verifying | completed | Verification passed |
| verifying | failed | Verification failed |
| waiting | connecting | Peer comes online |
| waiting | failed | Patient mode timeout |
| waiting | cancelled | User cancels |
| paused | queued | User resumes |
| paused | cancelled | User cancels |
| failed | queued | User retries |

## Transfer Types

### Download

Files downloaded from a remote peer to local storage.

```dart
TransferRequest(
  direction: TransferDirection.download,
  remoteUrl: "http://p2p.radio/download.zip", // HTTP/HTTPS direct download
  localPath: "/downloads/download.zip",
  expectedBytes: 1048576,
  priority: TransferPriority.normal,
  requestingApp: "gallery",
  metadata: {},
)

// Callsign / non-IP download (BLE/LoRa/Station)
TransferRequest(
  direction: TransferDirection.download,
  callsign: "X1ABCD",           // Source callsign
  stationUrl: "https://...",    // Optional station URL
  remotePath: "/files/doc.pdf", // Path on remote device
  localPath: "/downloads/doc.pdf", // Destination path
  expectedBytes: 1048576,       // Optional expected size
  expectedHash: "sha256:...",   // Optional hash for verification
  priority: TransferPriority.normal,
  requestingApp: "gallery",     // App that requested this
  metadata: {},                 // Optional app-specific data
)
```

### Upload

Files uploaded from local storage to a remote peer.

```dart
TransferRequest(
  direction: TransferDirection.upload,
  callsign: "X1ABCD",           // Target callsign
  stationUrl: "https://...",    // Optional station URL
  remotePath: "/inbox/doc.pdf", // Destination on remote
  localPath: "/documents/doc.pdf", // Local source path
  priority: TransferPriority.normal,
  requestingApp: "share",
  metadata: {},
)
```

### Stream

Continuous data stream (e.g., audio/video).

```dart
TransferRequest(
  direction: TransferDirection.stream,
  callsign: "X1ABCD",
  stationUrl: "https://...",
  remotePath: "/streams/audio",
  localPath: null,              // No local storage for streams
  priority: TransferPriority.high,
  requestingApp: "voip",
  metadata: {"codec": "opus", "bitrate": 64000},
)
```

## Addressing & Transport Selection

### Locator Rules

- **HTTP(S) locator**: `remote_url` starts with `http://` or `https://`. No callsign is required; the HTTP client must support Range requests for resume.
- **Callsign/non-IP locator**: Paths starting with `/<CALLSIGN>/...` target BLE/LoRa/radio transports first and may relay via Station/Internet when available. `stationUrl` remains optional for mediated delivery.
- Locators are normalized before queuing to avoid duplicates (e.g., trailing slashes removed, lowercase hostnames).

### Transport Selection & Switching

- Default attempt order (fastest to slowest, overridable per request via `transport_candidates`): LAN > WebRTC > Station/Internet > BLE > LoRa/Radio.
- On any transport failure, the worker opens a new transport segment and resumes from the last verified byte using HTTP Range or chunk-index negotiation.
- Each transport switch is recorded in the transfer record with byte ranges and timings.
- Patient mode still applies; if no transports are available, the transfer stays in `waiting` until a candidate becomes reachable or timeout occurs.

### Hash Negotiation

- When a hash is not supplied, the requester asks the remote peer for a SHA-1 digest:
  - HTTP(S): try `HEAD` with `X-File-Sha1` header (fallback to `ETag`/`Content-MD5` if SHA-1 unavailable).
  - Callsign/non-IP sessions: include `sha1` in the initial `transfer_session_start` metadata.
- `negotiated_hash` is stored in the transfer record and used for verification and cache lookup.

## Transfer Records & History

Every transfer writes a detailed record under `{data_dir}/transfers/records/{transfer_id}.json` capturing per-transport progress, hashes, and outcomes.

Example record:

```json
{
  "version": "1.1",
  "transfer_id": "tr_abc123",
  "direction": "download",
  "locator": "http://p2p.radio/download.zip",
  "filename": "download.zip",
  "expected_bytes": 1048576,
  "expected_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
  "negotiated_hash": "sha1:def456...",
  "created_at": "2026-01-18T11:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-01-18T11:05:30Z",
  "segments": [
    {"transport": "lan", "from_byte": 0, "to_byte": 524287, "bytes": 524288, "duration_ms": 3200, "retries": 0, "started_at": "2026-01-18T11:00:05Z"},
    {"transport": "ble", "from_byte": 524288, "to_byte": 534527, "bytes": 10240, "duration_ms": 60000, "retries": 1, "started_at": "2026-01-18T11:02:00Z"}
  ],
  "totals_by_transport": {"lan": 524288, "ble": 10240},
  "verification": {
    "verified": true,
    "hash_used": "sha1:def456...",
    "verified_at": "2026-01-18T11:05:25Z"
  },
  "cache": {
    "cache_hit": false,
    "cache_path": "/data/transfers/cache/sha1/def456/download.zip",
    "last_accessed_at": "2026-01-18T11:05:30Z"
  },
  "status": "completed",
  "error": null
}
```

- Records are used for resume (segment offsets), for metrics aggregation, and as provenance for cached files.
- Uploads use the same schema but track `bytes_sent` per segment.

## Cache & Retention

- **Cache before download**: If a verified cached file exists for the requested hash/locator, fulfill the request immediately (`cache_hit=true`) and place/link the cached file to `local_path`.
- **Cache after download**: After verification, copy/link the file into `{data_dir}/transfers/cache/{hash_type}/{hash_value}/filename` for future reuse.
- **Retention**: Per-transfer records are deleted after 30 days. Cache entries follow an LRU policy and are eligible for deletion after 30 days without access or when exceeding size thresholds. Monthly history/metrics remain for long-term stats.
- **Repeat requests**: New download requests first check the cache; if present and hashes match, no network transfer is attempted.

## Queue Management

### Priority Ordering

Transfers are ordered by:
1. **Priority** (descending): urgent > high > normal > low
2. **Creation time** (ascending): FIFO within same priority

| Priority | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `urgent` | User-initiated immediate transfers |
| `high` | Interactive transfers (chat media) |
| `normal` | Background downloads (gallery sync) |
| `low` | Batch operations (backup restoration) |

### Queue Operations

```dart
// Request new transfer
Transfer transfer = await transferService.requestDownload(request);

// Query transfers
Transfer? t = transferService.getTransfer(transferId);
Transfer? t = transferService.findTransfer(callsign: "X1ABCD", remotePath: "/file.txt");
bool exists = transferService.isAlreadyRequested("X1ABCD", "/file.txt");
List<Transfer> active = transferService.getActiveTransfers();
List<Transfer> queued = transferService.getQueuedTransfers();
List<Transfer> completed = transferService.getCompletedTransfers(limit: 50);

// Control transfers
await transferService.pause(transferId);
await transferService.resume(transferId);
await transferService.cancel(transferId);
await transferService.retry(transferId);
```

## Retry Policy

### Exponential Backoff

Retry delays increase exponentially up to a maximum:

```
delay = min(base * (multiplier ^ retry_count), max_delay)
```

With defaults (base=30s, multiplier=2, max=1h):

| Retry | Delay | Cumulative Wait |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | 30s | 30s |
| 2 | 1m | 1.5m |
| 3 | 2m | 3.5m |
| 4 | 4m | 7.5m |
| 5 | 8m | 15.5m |
| 6 | 16m | 31.5m |
| 7 | 32m | 1h 3.5m |
| 8+ | 1h | ~4h+ |

### Retry Triggers

Automatic retry occurs for:
- Connection timeout
- Connection reset
- Network unreachable
- Peer temporarily unavailable

No retry for:
- File not found (404)
- Permission denied (403)
- Invalid request (400)
- User cancellation

## Patient Mode

When a peer is offline, transfers enter "waiting" state instead of failing immediately.

### Behavior

1. Transfer attempts connection
2. Connection fails (peer offline)
3. Transfer enters `waiting` state
4. Periodic reconnection attempts (using retry backoff)
5. After `patient_mode_timeout_days`, transfer fails

### Patient Mode Settings

```json
{
  "patient_mode_timeout_days": 30
}
```

### Use Cases

- Sending files to mobile devices that are frequently offline
- Syncing with devices on slow/intermittent connections
- Backup transfers to devices behind NAT without relay

## Ban List

Block specific callsigns from downloading files.

### Usage

```dart
// Add to ban list
await transferService.banCallsign("X1ABCD");

// Remove from ban list
await transferService.unbanCallsign("X1ABCD");

// Check if banned
bool banned = transferService.isCallsignBanned("X1ABCD");
```

### Effect

When a banned callsign attempts to download:
1. Transfer request is rejected
2. `TransferFailedEvent` fired with error "callsign_banned"
3. No entry created in transfer queue

### API

```
GET    /api/transfers/banned              - List banned callsigns
POST   /api/transfers/banned              - Add to ban list
DELETE /api/transfers/banned/{callsign}   - Remove from ban list
```

## Verification

### Size Verification

All downloads verify file size after transfer:

```dart
if (transfer.expectedBytes != null) {
  if (downloadedBytes != transfer.expectedBytes) {
    // Mark as failed, trigger retry
  }
}
```

### Hash Verification

Hash verification prefers SHA-1 negotiated from the remote peer; falls back to supplied hashes (SHA-256 supported) or HTTP `ETag` when necessary:

```dart
final hashToUse = transfer.negotiatedHash ?? transfer.expectedHash;
if (hashToUse != null) {
  final actualHash = await computeHash(tempFile, hashToUse);
  if (actualHash != hashToUse) {
    // Mark as failed, trigger retry
  }
}
```

### File Placement

Files are placed at final destination only after verification:

1. Download to temporary location: `{temp_dir}/transfer_{id}.tmp`
2. Verify size (if expected_bytes provided)
3. Verify hash (if expected_hash provided)
4. Move to final destination: `{local_path}`
5. Fire `TransferCompletedEvent`

Notes:
- Debug transfers still emit normal events and write per-transport records for inspection.
- Only enabled when the app/server runs in a debug/testing mode; production must reject with 403.
- If the forced transport is unavailable, the request fails fast with an error; no fallback switching occurs.

## EventBus Integration

The Transfer service fires events on the EventBus for app notifications.

### Events

#### TransferRequestedEvent

Fired when a new transfer is requested.

```dart
class TransferRequestedEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
  TransferEventDirection direction;
  String callsign;
  String path;
  String? requestingApp;
}
```

#### TransferProgressEvent

Fired periodically during active transfers.

```dart
class TransferProgressEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
  TransferStatus status;
  int bytesTransferred;
  int totalBytes;
  double? speedBytesPerSecond;
  Duration? eta;
}
```

#### TransferCompletedEvent

Fired when transfer completes successfully.

```dart
class TransferCompletedEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
  TransferEventDirection direction;
  String callsign;
  String localPath;
  int totalBytes;
  Duration duration;
  String transportUsed;
  String? requestingApp;
  Map<String, dynamic>? metadata;
}
```

#### TransferFailedEvent

Fired when transfer fails.

```dart
class TransferFailedEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
  TransferEventDirection direction;
  String callsign;
  String path;
  String error;
  bool willRetry;
  DateTime? nextRetryAt;
  String? requestingApp;
}
```

#### TransferCancelledEvent

Fired when user cancels a transfer.

```dart
class TransferCancelledEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
  String? requestingApp;
}
```

#### TransferPausedEvent

Fired when user pauses a transfer.

```dart
class TransferPausedEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
}
```

#### TransferResumedEvent

Fired when user resumes a transfer.

```dart
class TransferResumedEvent extends AppEvent {
  String transferId;
}
```

### Subscribing to Events

Apps can subscribe to transfer events:

```dart
eventBus.on<TransferCompletedEvent>((event) {
  if (event.requestingApp == 'gallery') {
    // Handle gallery download completion
    refreshGallery(event.localPath);
  }
});
```

## Metrics & Statistics

### Real-Time Metrics

```dart
class TransferMetrics {
  int activeConnections;           // Current open connections
  int activeTransfers;             // Currently transferring
  int queuedTransfers;             // Waiting in queue
  double currentSpeedBytesPerSecond; // Aggregate speed

  TransferPeriodStats today;
  TransferPeriodStats thisWeek;
  TransferPeriodStats thisMonth;
  TransferPeriodStats allTime;

  Map<String, TransportStats> byTransport;
  List<CallsignStats> topCallsigns;
}
```

### Period Statistics

```dart
class TransferPeriodStats {
  int uploadCount;
  int downloadCount;
  int streamCount;
  int bytesUploaded;
  int bytesDownloaded;
  int failedCount;
  Duration totalTransferTime;
  double averageSpeedBytesPerSecond;
  double successRate;  // 0.0 - 1.0
}
```

### Transport Statistics

```dart
class TransportStats {
  String transportId;  // lan, webrtc, station, ble, lora, internet
  int transferCount;
  int bytesTransferred;
  double averageSpeed;
  double successRate;
}
```

### Callsign Statistics

```dart
class CallsignStats {
  String callsign;
  int uploadCount;
  int downloadCount;
  int bytesUploaded;
  int bytesDownloaded;
  DateTime lastActivity;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error Code | Description | Retry? |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| `connection_timeout` | Connection attempt timed out | Yes |
| `connection_refused` | Remote peer refused connection | Yes |
| `peer_offline` | Remote peer is offline | Yes (patient mode) |
| `file_not_found` | Remote file does not exist | No |
| `permission_denied` | Access denied to remote file | No |
| `callsign_banned` | Callsign is on ban list | No |
| `size_mismatch` | Downloaded size != expected | Yes |
| `hash_mismatch` | Hash verification failed | Yes |
| `disk_full` | Local disk space exhausted | No |
| `cancelled` | User cancelled transfer | No |
| `patient_timeout` | Patient mode timeout exceeded | No |

### Error Recovery

1. **Transient errors**: Automatic retry with backoff
2. **Permanent errors**: Mark failed, notify requesting app
3. **Partial downloads**: Resume from last position on retry
4. **Verification failures**: Delete temp file, retry from start

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- All P2P transfers authenticated via ConnectionManager
- Station relay transfers use NOSTR signatures
- API endpoints require local authentication

### Authorization

- Ban list prevents unauthorized downloads
- Apps can only access their own transfer metadata
- Remote file access controlled by file permissions

### Data Integrity

- Optional SHA-256 hash verification
- Size verification for all transfers
- Atomic file placement (temp -> final)

### Privacy

- Transfer history stored locally only
- Metrics aggregated, no detailed logs shared
- Callsign statistics kept private

### Resource Limits

- Queue size limits prevent memory exhaustion
- Concurrent transfer limits prevent bandwidth monopolization
- Automatic cleanup of stale transfers
