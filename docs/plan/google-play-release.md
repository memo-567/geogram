   - See Step 6 below for privacy policy template

### Step 2: Create Service Account for API Access

1. **In Google Cloud Console** (https://console.cloud.google.com):
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Play Android Developer API"
   - Click "Enable"
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Name it something like "geogram-play-deploy"
   - Click "Create and Continue"
   - Skip the optional steps, click "Done"
   - Click on the service account you just created
   - Go to "Keys" tab > "Add Key" > "Create new key"
   - Select JSON format
   - Download and save the JSON file securely

2. **In Play Console** (https://play.google.com/console):
   - Go to "Settings" (gear icon) > "API access"
   - Click "Link" next to Google Cloud project (or create new link)
   - Find your service account in the list
   - Click "Grant access"
   - Under "App permissions", add your app
   - Under "Account permissions", select:
     - "Release apps to testing tracks"
     - "Release apps to production" (if you want full automation)
   - Click "Invite user"
   - Accept the invitation

3. **Store securely as GitHub Secret**:
   - Go to your GitHub repo > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
   - Value: Paste the entire contents of the JSON key file
   - Click "Add secret"

### Step 3: Create Fastlane Configuration

**File: `fastlane/Appfile`**
```ruby
package_name("dev.geogram")
json_key_file("fastlane/play-store-key.json")
```

**File: `fastlane/Fastfile`**
```ruby
default_platform(:android)

platform :android do
  desc "Upload to Google Play internal track"
  lane :internal do
    upload_to_play_store(
      track: 'internal',
      aab: '../build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab',
      skip_upload_metadata: false,
      skip_upload_images: true,
      skip_upload_screenshots: true
    )
  end

  desc "Promote to production"
  lane :production do
    upload_to_play_store(
      track: 'production',
      aab: '../build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab'
    )
  end
end
```

**File: `fastlane/Gemfile`**
```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "fastlane"
```

### Step 4: Update GitHub Actions for Automated Uploads

The workflow will automatically upload to Google Play when you push a version tag.

**How it works:**

1. You push a tag like `v1.6.76`
2. GitHub Actions builds the AAB (already configured)
3. Fastlane uploads the AAB to Play Store internal track
4. You promote from internal to production in Play Console (or automate later)

**Changes to `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`:**

Add these steps after the existing "Upload AAB to Release" step:

```yaml
    # Install Ruby and Fastlane
    - name: Set up Ruby
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: '3.2'
        bundler-cache: true
        working-directory: fastlane

    # Upload to Google Play Store
    - name: Upload to Google Play
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
      env:
        GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}
      run: |
        # Write the service account JSON to a file
        echo "$GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON" > fastlane/play-store-key.json

        # Run Fastlane to upload to internal track
        cd fastlane
        bundle exec fastlane internal

        # Clean up the key file
        rm -f play-store-key.json
```

**Tracks explanation:**
- `internal` - Only visible to internal testers you specify (immediate, no review)
- `alpha` - Closed testing with limited testers
- `beta` - Open testing, anyone can join
- `production` - Public release (may require review)

Starting with `internal` is safest - you can test before promoting to production.

### Step 5: First Manual Upload

For the first release, Google requires a manual upload:

1. Build AAB locally: `flutter build appbundle --release`
   - Or download from GitHub Actions artifact
2. Go to Play Console > Your app > Production > Create new release
3. Upload the AAB file (`build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`)
4. Add release notes
5. Complete all required store listing fields
6. Submit for review

After the first upload is approved, automated uploads will work.

### Step 6: Create Privacy Policy

Create and host the privacy policy at `https://geogram.radio/privacy`:

```markdown
