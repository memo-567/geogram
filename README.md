# Geogram Desktop

A cross-platform desktop and mobile application for Geogram, built with Flutter.

## Supported Platforms

- **Linux** (Desktop) - Full support
- **Windows** (Desktop) - Full support (requires Windows to build, or use GitHub Actions)
- **macOS** (Desktop) - Full support
- **Web** - Full support
- **Android** - Full support
- **iOS** - Full support

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.38.3+ with Dart 3.10+ (installed in ~/flutter)
- For Linux: GTK development libraries (ninja-build, clang, libgtk-3-dev, liblzma-dev)
- For Windows: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ tools
- For macOS: Xcode
- For Android: Android Studio and SDK
- For iOS: Xcode (macOS only)
- For Web: Chrome or another web browser

## Quick Setup (New Machine)

### Linux

Run the automated setup script to install all dependencies and Flutter:

```bash
cd geogram-desktop
./setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Install Linux system dependencies (requires sudo)
2. Download and install Flutter 3.38.3+ with Dart 3.10+
3. Run flutter doctor to verify the installation

Or install components individually:

```bash
# Install Linux dependencies only
./install-linux-deps.sh

# Install Flutter only (with resume support for slow connections)
./install-flutter.sh
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual installation or need a different Flutter version:

1. Install Flutter SDK 3.38.3+ from https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Ensure Dart SDK version is 3.10.0 or higher (check with `flutter --version`)
3. Install platform-specific dependencies (see Prerequisites)

**Important:** This project requires Dart SDK ^3.10.0 (specified in pubspec.yaml). Flutter 3.27.x and earlier versions will NOT work as they include older Dart versions.

## Building

### Quick Start Scripts

- Linux: `./rebuild-desktop.sh` or `./launch-desktop.sh`
- Windows: `build-windows.bat` or `build-windows.sh`
- Web: `./launch-web.sh`
- Android: `./launch-android.sh`

**Note:** The `launch-desktop.sh` script automatically checks for the correct Flutter and Dart versions before launching.

### Detailed Build Instructions

- **Linux**: See [docs/installation/INSTALL.md](docs/installation/INSTALL.md)
- **Windows**: See [docs/build/BUILD_WINDOWS.md](docs/build/BUILD_WINDOWS.md) and [docs/installation/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md](docs/installation/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md)
- **Releases**: See [docs/build/RELEASE.md](docs/build/RELEASE.md) for creating releases
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated builds for all platforms - see `.github/workflows/`

## Running the Application

### Adding Flutter to PATH

Add Flutter to your PATH for easier access:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
```

To make this permanent, add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

### Linux Desktop

```bash
cd geogram_desktop
flutter run -d linux
```

### macOS Desktop

```bash
cd geogram_desktop
flutter run -d macos
```

### Web

```bash
cd geogram_desktop
flutter run -d chrome
```

Or to build for web deployment:

```bash
flutter build web
```

The built files will be in `build/web/`.

### Android

Connect an Android device or start an emulator, then:

```bash
cd geogram_desktop
flutter run -d android
```

### iOS

Connect an iOS device or start a simulator (macOS only), then:

```bash
cd geogram_desktop
flutter run -d ios
```
